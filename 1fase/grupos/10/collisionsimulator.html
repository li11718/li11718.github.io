Errors:

Tarefa3_2017li1g10.hs:26:19: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Maybe Carro’
                  with actual type ‘Ponto -&gt; Carro -&gt; Maybe Carro’
    • Probable cause: ‘intersecoes’ is applied to too few arguments
      In the expression: intersecoes (m (move t c m) c)
      In an equation for ‘movimenta’:
          movimenta m t c = intersecoes (m (move t c m) c)

Tarefa3_2017li1g10.hs:26:32: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Maybe Ponto -&gt; Carro -&gt; Tabuleiro’
                  with actual type ‘[[Peca]]’
    • The function ‘m’ is applied to two arguments,
      but its type ‘[[Peca]]’ has none
      In the first argument of ‘intersecoes’, namely ‘(m (move t c m) c)’
      In the expression: intersecoes (m (move t c m) c)
